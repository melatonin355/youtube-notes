 # Bugs per Line of Code: An Insight into Software Development

Software development is an integral part of modern society, from the code running nuclear weapons to the programs that run social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. With so much code being written, it's natural to wonder how many bugs are present in each line of code. In this article, we'll explore the concept of bugs per line of code and discuss the findings of various studies and reports.

## Bugs per Line of Code

The idea of bugs per line of code is simple -  it refers to the number of errors or defects present in each line of code. The higher the number, the more bugs are present, and the more work is required to fix them. The number of bugs per line of code varies depending on the software, language, and development style used. However, studies have shown that, on average, mature software contains about one bug per thousand lines of code.

## Reports and Findings

A report by a programming analytics company found that, on average, developers create 70 bugs per 1000 lines of code, and 15 bugs per 1000 lines of code find their way to customers. Fixing a bug takes 30 times longer than writing a line of code, and 75% of a developer's time is spent on debugging. This means that, on average, developers spend 1500 hours a year in the US alone on identifying and fixing bugs. This costs the industry $113 billion annually.

However, it's worth noting that reports like these are often used as marketing literature for companies claiming to have a solution for fixing bugs. In reality, there is no silver bullet that can make all the investment in fixing bugs go away.

## The Development Process

The development process is highly iterative. Developers don't make a plan for what software they will release a year from now, as all the details consist of composing a program, and even the plans will have bugs in them. Typically, developers type out the code, and mistakes are often made. Even experienced developers use the backspace key, and mistyping a word and correcting it immediately is not a bug. However, forgetting to initialize a variable is a bug that can go unnoticed and cause problems.

## The Role of Keyboards

The type of keyboard a developer uses can affect productivity. The Kinesis keyboard, for example, has the backspace key under the thumb, which reduces the amount of stretching required to use it. However, it's essential to adapt to other keyboard types, as not everyone has access to a specific type of keyboard at all times. It's important to find the setup that maximizes productivity, and this may involve using specific tools and programs that developers are comfortable with, even if they are not the latest and greatest.

## Conclusion

Bugs per line of code is a crucial metric in software development, and it's essential to keep it as low as possible. Reports and studies have shown that bugs can be costly and time-consuming, so developers must invest time in debugging and identifying errors. While the development process is iterative, developers can adopt specific tools and programs that maximize productivity and minimize the number of bugs present in each line of code.
